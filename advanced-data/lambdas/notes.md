# AWS Lambda

A lambda in python is an anonymous function

AWS Lambda is a service that offers "serverless" compute
- by serverless I mean, has a server, but you don't have to worry about config

Pro:
- No need to worry about infrastructure
- Pay for only what you need
- Easy to connect to other services
- Scales automatically

Cons:
- Can only run for 15 minutes at a time
- Requires specific code design / infrastructure
- Limited memory
