## Key Aspects of OOP

### A PIE

**Abstraction** - The base representation of the object that can be used again and again
    - A recipe / blueprint

**Polymorphism** - A set of shared qualities that all objects share
    - We can change the recipe for a pie without changing the essence of the pie

**Inheritance** - Classes can inherit from one another
    - We can have a base pie, but several other types that inherit from it (blueberry pie and kidney pies share the same parent class)

**Encapsulation** - Everything inside of the code is not referenced outside of it
    - I don't need to know how the pie is made to be able to use it

Class - blueprint
Instance - when you make a actual instance of a class
