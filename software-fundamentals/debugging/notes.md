# Debugging

## Types of bugs

Crashes - When the code breaks and stops

Logical Errors - The code doesn't break, but its wrong

## Crashes

A method for fixing:

1. Read the error message
2. Follow the traceback from bottom to top, find the offending line of code
3. Fix it
   1. Think about using `print()` statements to show what is actually happening
   2. Come up with a theory of why this is happening
   3. Attempt a fix
   4. If that doesn't work, delete and try again
4. Move on to the next error

## Logic Errors

1. What is the code doing (generally)?
2. What is the expected output
3. Follow the flow of the code
