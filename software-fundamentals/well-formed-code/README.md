# Well-formed code

Notes on correctly styling Python.

## Principles

- Code is read more than it is written.
- Developer time is more precious than computer time.
- You should code as though the next developer has anger issues and your address.
- You will forget your code.
- Functions should do **one** thing well.

## Structure of a Python file

1. Imports
2. Constants (if you must)
3. Definitions
4. Actions (inside a `__main__` block)
